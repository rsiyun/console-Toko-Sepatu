## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.


## Usage
  ## 1 clone this folder
  ## 2 download jar dependency from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
  ## 3 run this project

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains 3 folders and 1 file by default, where:

- `App`: contain admin flow, user flow and Auth
- `Entity` : contain object for connect to database
- `Service` : contain reuse function
- `App.java` : Main File from this Project

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
